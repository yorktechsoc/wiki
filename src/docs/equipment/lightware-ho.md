## What?
The Lightware HOs are our "old" uplighers, and have seen a number of years use in the film industry before they found their way to TechSoc.  
They are slightly water resistant, but *not* waterproof - if you need waterproof ones, use our new uplighters! They've had plenty of alcohol near them but don't survive direct contact very well.  

## General Technical Info

### DMX allocation
| Relative Address | Function | 
| -- | -- | 
| 1 | Red |  
| 2 | Green |  
| 3 | Blue |  
  
:::caution

The Lightware HOs will strobe if their DMX address is less than 100.  
If you encounter this, change your whole DMX patch so they're above 100.

## Technical fun facts
They are run off motorcycle batteries, which makes them very user serviceable - just swap them out.
